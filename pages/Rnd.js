            It&apos;s cold, but you guessed that already, it&apos;s also the
            highest and windiest continent. It has a heart of glass and is
            entranced by some of the purest water on the planet. The
            continent&apos;s population comprises mainly of research staff.
            Research and development are the set of innovative activities
            undertaken by corporations and governments in developing new
