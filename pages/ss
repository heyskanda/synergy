            Goodbye Atlantis, Hello &quot;Greater Adria&apos;.
Take a hike along the mountain belts scattered around the Adriatic Sea, and you may find yourself clambering across the crumpled leftovers of a long-lost continent. &quot;Forget Atlantis. Without realising it, vast numbers of tourists spend their holiday each year on the lost continent of Greater Adria&quot;, As you forgot looking your life through the lens. Describing every single detail, through every leaf vein to capturing every single moment of your life through the reels. Have a greater view of the mountains through the lens. Why just watch Greater Adria through eyes? Where you can capture it through the third eye.
&apos;This is &quot;Photography&quot; cause every single moment Matters&apos;.
